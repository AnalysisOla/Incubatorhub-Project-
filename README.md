### Data Source

The Primary Data Source is given by Incubator Hub.

### Tools Used

- Pivot Table
- Ms Excel (Presentation)

### Data Cleaning and Preparation

In the initial phase of the data cleaning and preparation, we perform the following actions;

1. Data loading and Inspections
2. Handling missing variables
3. Data cleaning and formatting

### Exploratory Data Analysis 

EDA involved the exploring of the Data to answer some quetions about the data such as;
1. What is the average discount percentage by product category?
2. How many products are listed under each category?
3. What is the total number of reviews per category?
4. Which products have the highest average ratings?
5. What is the average actual price vs the discounted price by category?
6. Which products have the highest number of reviews?
7. How many products have a discount of 50% or more?
8. What is the distribution of product ratings (e.g., how many products are rated 3.0,
4.0, etc.)?
9. What is the total potential revenue (actual_price Ã— rating_count) by category?

### Recommendations

1. Product Quality Improvements:

- Address charging speed inconsistencies in cables
- Improve TV sound systems and OS performance

2. Pricing Strategy:

- Maintain competitive discounting on cables

- Consider bundling accessories with TVs

3. Customer Service:

- Standardize TV installation services

- Expand Linux support for networking devices

4. Product Development:

- Develop more high-end cable options with premium features

- Consider longer warranty periods for TV panels

  ### Conclusion
  
The dataset reveals Amazon's strong position in the cables and accessories market, with opportunities to improve in the TV segment. Customer satisfaction is generally high, particularly with properly discounted products. Focusing on quality consistency and after-sales service could further enhance the customer experience.
